  <h1>Dark Orchid for Discord</h1>

  A [Discord](https://discord.com/) Colorscheme, that's purple.

  The Dark Orchid Theme is a cohesive visual ecosystem built around the striking color purple. Centered on the rich Dark Orchid shade, it highlights purple's depth, creativity, and elegance. Through balanced contrasts and unified tones, the theme creates a bold yet harmonious aesthetic that stands out across any design.

## Non-Goals

**BetterDiscord**

The Dark Orchid ecosystem aims to be low overhead and should only change necessary sections while keeping the original feel and behavior of Discord.

As BetterDiscord Guidelines writes:
> ”... Themes should provide a cohesive design that notably alters the look and feel of Discord ...“

Because of their Guidelines, BetterDiscord will not be supported.
